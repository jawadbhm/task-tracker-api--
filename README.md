# Task Tracker
A simple React + TypeScript task tracker that lets you create, update, and manage tasks through a clean web interface. This project is part of my portfolio as I practice frontend development, component structure, and state management.

## 🚀 What it does
- Display a list of tasks  
- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Remove tasks  
- (Depending on the version) store tasks in memory or local storage

## 🛠 Tech stack
- React  
- TypeScript  
- Vite (frontend tooling)  
- Basic project scripts (dev, build, preview)

## ▶️ How to run it locally
1. Install dependencies:  
   npm install  
2. Start the development server:  
   npm run dev  
3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 🌱 Why I built this
I created this project to practice managing component state in React, organizing a small codebase, working with TypeScript types, using Vite’s fast development environment, and publishing clean projects on GitHub.

## 🚧 Future improvements
- Persist tasks using localStorage or an API  
- Add task filtering (completed / active)  
- Support priorities or due dates  
- Improve form validation and overall UX
